# Package Development 

## Work Flow 


**Step 1: Document** 

Update any documentation pages with `devtools::document()` 

**Step 2: Check** 

Run basic tests (and any unit tests created) using `devtools::check()` 


**Step 3: Install** 

Install the working version of your package with `devtools::install()` 


There is also the option to use `devtools::load_all()` which will load all functions in the package.  However, this will not work if you are testing functions that use files in the `/inst` folder.  


**Step 4: Restart R** 

Restart your R session/environment to test the functions with a clean slate.
