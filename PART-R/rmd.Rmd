## Images 

### Markdown

Re sizing images in Markdown is required if you are knitting to a pdf - because you can't use HTML code.  

[Tip and tricks for workign wtih images and figures in R Markdown documents - hollie@zevross.com](http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/)

Adjust the `out.width` and `out.height` in the R chunk options

```
{r, out.width="50%"}  
img <- "img/Peegs.jpg" #path to image  
knitr::include_graphics(img) #in the knitr package   
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
img <- "img/Peegs.jpg" #path to image 
knitr::include_graphics(img) #in the knitr package 
```

###  HTML in markdown  
In my opinion, HTML is a lot easier to use for images options.  

[HTML Images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)

`<img src="img/Peegs.jpg" alt="this is Daffodil and Blossom" width="50%"> `  
<img src="img/Peegs.jpg" alt="this is Daffodil and Blossom" width="50%">
